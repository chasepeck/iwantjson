# **iwantjson**
## *easy(ish) json*
---
## **Usage**
Create a script tag with the `src` of `https://www.chasepeck.com/iwantjson/iwantjson.js`.<br>
Set the `url` attribute to the URL you want to receive the JSON from.<br>
Set the `key` attribute to the key you want to get. You can get keys within objects by using periods in your key. (See example on `index.html`) For example, there could be a `Foo` object, and within that could be a `Test` key. So the correct key would be `Foo.Test`. You can go an infinite amount of layers deep.

---
## **Why**
This is aimed toward JavaScript beginners (like me) so that you can use dynamic data in your projects.
